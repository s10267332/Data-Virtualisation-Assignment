# Data-Virtualisation-Assignment
This repository contains the documentation deliverables for my individual Data Virtualization project built in Denodo. I designed an end-to-end virtualized reporting solution that integrates 7 retail CSV datasets into a single business-ready Reporting View (RV), then published it as a REST web service for lightweight downstream consumption.
